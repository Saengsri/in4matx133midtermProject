				One of the biggest impacts in my life is the martial arts. When I was 11 years-
				old, my mom opened her business in a small plaza in the city of Walnut. After
				helping her transition into her new business, I stumbled upon a martial arts 
				school within the same plaza. Little did I know, I was continue this hobby until 
				this very day. 
				<br><br>&emsp;	
				The martial arts has given me the opportunity to expand my boundaries. After 
				six and a half years, I earned my black belt, a rare feat that many do not 
				accomplish. In addition, I was challenged by the opportunity to compete in the 
				instructor division at tournaments, in which I grew watching the previous 
				generations of instructors demostrate their martial arts ability. Not to 
				mention, I took my first trip on an airplane to China on a company trip 
				for training with Shaolin Monks and Wudang Monks. In China, I went sight-seeing
				and was on vacation.
				<br><br>&emsp;
				Aside from learning how to defend myself and the opportunites presented to 
				me, the martial arts shaped my character into who I am today. In addition, 
				my martial arts instructor, Sensei Charlie, ended up being someone I could 
				always admired and communicate with whenever I had an issue. Today, I am glad to 
				have him as a friend and a brother. He always has my best interest in heart, and 
				I know no matter where I end up in life, I can continuously reach out to him. I 
				am grateful for the martial arts school and able to call it another home.

				The Management Information Student Society, or MAISS, at University of 
				California at Irvine is an organization for students, who have interests
				in business and technology, to meet other students who share the same 
				interests. MAISS offers professional workshops, co-hosts business/technology
				companies, and a mentorship program.
				<br><br>&emsp;
				I first heard about the organization from my hallmate from freshman year, Ishan, 
				who is currently the President of the organization. He told me how I would be a 
				good fit for the mentorship program, and I should check it out. Up until that 
				moment, I, personally, have been focused on school and work. However, I enjoyed
				my time at UCI, a school that had provided me with opportunities and tools to 
				learn about myself and grow. So, I decided to apply into the mentorship program 
				to give back to the UCI community.
				<br><br>&emsp;
				When I got into the mentorship program, I met Yolanda, a first-year at the time. 
				We did more than just giving advice: we hung out, I cooked for her, and listened 
				to her whenever she needed advice. The mentorship relationship we had was amazing, 
				and we mutually expressed how we were grateful to have each other in each other's 
				lives. Due to my great experience last year, I continued the mentorship program
				this year, and I got 3 more mentees: Irene, Vanessa, and Dayna. I hope to have 
				another wonderful experience with them and positively impact their lives.

				<strong class="section">Personality</strong>
					<br><br>&emsp;
					First off, I am extremely, extraverted person, so I love meeting new people and
					talking with them; I am like a social butterly. However, I love getting to know
					other people and learning about them. Occassionally, I people-watch because I
					am fascinated by other people's interactions. Also, I like to think I am a well-
					rounded individual, so I love the outdoors and doing physical activities. 
					Nonetheless, some of my time is spent watching tv shows, especially anime like 
					Shokugeki no Soma and Full Metal Alchemist. I'll be honest too; I don't think I am 
					a smart individual. Regardless, my hard work ethic definitely drives me and makes 
					up for what I lack in intelligence.
				<br><br>
				<strong class="section">Cooking</strong>
					<br><br>&emsp;
					Recently, I have picked up cooking, since I do my best to eat healthy and not 
					spend too much money eating out. One of my favorite things to cook is 
					Fettuccini Chicken Alfredo. I spent a lot of time making it good, so I even cook
					my own Alfredo sauce (It's delicious, trust me). I hope to expand my cooking when 
					I finish school, just because I will have more time. I want to cook a variety of 
					cuisines from differently cultures, even lifestyle choices like vegan food, which 
					is an artform in of itself. Many vegan dishes are made bland, when some professionals
					are able to give the dish strong unami (cooking term for taste.
				<br><br>
				<strong class="section">Other</strong>
					<br><br>&emsp;
					As I mentioned before, I been on an airplane one time in my life, which was to 
					China for martial arts. After going on that trip, I instantly got the travel bug.
					I want to continue traveling at least once a year to a new place, whether its on
					the other side of the country or in a whole new country. I like meeting people of
					different cultures and just doing things I wouldn't normally be able to in 
					Southern California.
