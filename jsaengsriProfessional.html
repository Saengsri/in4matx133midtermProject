		<h4>General Bio:</h4>

		<p class="bio">Hi, my name is Jeff Saengsri! I am a 4th-year Business Information
		Management major. Throughout my college career, I have been both a full-time student
		and major. Thanks to my hard work, I have been able to graduate from UCI early. Currently,
		I am working with a company called Terra Tech, which has given me the bandwidth to 
		work in marketing, IT, product development, and other areas of business. With this
		experience and future experience, I hope to have more knowledge for when I open my own 
		business.
