			Hello everyone, when I made my portfolio, I just wanted to create a website
			to start creating my online presence. Eventually, I would use this project as
			a shell for me to continue building upon, eventually leading to home page for
			people to learn more about me, see my resume, and learn about me personally 
			through a blog or linking to my social media sites.

			<h3>User Interviews</h3>
			<p class="writing">
				In my user interviews, I mostly contacted students about to graduate from college.
				The reason why I wanted to focus on them was because I wanted to see what their 
				struggles were in terms of finding a job after college, which means they are trying
				to stand out amongst their crowd.
				<br><br>

			<h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
			<p class="writing">
				I looked specifically and other websites that displaying professional information about 
				individuals, such as LinkedIn. I wanted to see what were the other avenues of displaying
				information, so I could mimic and improved on their designs.

			<h3>Feature Value Matrix</h3>
			<p class="writing">			
				I focused on the requirements and thought about what would appeal on users. The two general 
				areas I wanted to focus on were simplistic design, as well as giving a little personaility
				to a portfolio, such as showing pictures of myself.

			<h3>Feature Prioritization</h3>
			<p class="writing">
				I prioritized features to appeal specifically for both business and non-business users.
				At the end of the day, users are going to be the reason why a digital portfolio succeeds 
				or not.

			<h3>User Stories</h3>
			<p class="writing">
				Users are driving the success behind a product or service. So, thinking about how
				the direct users will be using a product/service is crucial. I thought about the purpose 
				of my website, which added some personal flare; therefore, I focused on non-business user.

			<h3>Cognitive Walkthroughs</h3>
			<p class="writing">
				A cognitive walkthrough is evaluation of a series of task, as well as questions about the 
				perspective of the user. They are important because the qualitative information directly from
				the user. A challenge I experience from one of my cognitive walkthrough was that one of my
				interviewees keep going away from the question/problem.

			</p>	
			<h3>User Test</h3>
			<p class="writing">
				The types of the user tests that I had people do were question tests and click tests because 
				I wanted to test the how well users were performing tasks. Using usability hub, the instructions
				were given for the click were given before the test started, so if the user forget or misread, 
				then there was a good chance they failed, which happened in my results. For the most part, every
				user was able to perform the tasks and answer the questions correctly.

		<div class="summary">
			<h2 class="section">Summary of Findings</h2>
			<p class="writing">
				My goal for the user research was to discover what users, specifically graduating college students,
				were looking for as they were graduating and how were the attempting to standout. Based off my research,
				students wanted to have an easy solution to standing-out-amongst-the-crowd problem. Also, when looking 
				at competitors, I wanted to see how other places, like LinkedIn and Gary Vaynerchuk, were displaying
				online portfolios of an individual. In terms of facing any challenges during this point, I didn't face
				any.
				<br><br>
				In terms of user testing, I used the cognitive walkthroughs to focus more qualitative information and for
				the user testing, I focused more on the quantitive information. Overall I personally used the user testing
				to validate if the users approved of my simplistic design and personallity I added to my portfolio. For the
				most part, they did with a little individual changes here and there.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="wrap-up">
			<h2 class="section">Incorporation of Findings</h2>
			<p class="writing">
				I applied stylistic changes from what I gathered from the user testing if I agreed with the responses. There 
				were nuisances in my findings that I felt that were necessarily applicable because it might have applied to a
				small representation of the population. Some of the stylistic changes were making texts appear more friendly 
				to users, by their color and size. Also, from the time I submitted the midterm project and until now, my text 
				for whatever reason shifted, so I moved it to a more appropriate spot. 
				<br><br>
				If I had more time, some the changes I wanted to apply to my website would be improving the responsive design, 
				such as making it better for the mobile version. With my current level of skills and time left, I couldn't make 
				it better for the mobile version. One way to make the mobile version is make the website adaptive to the user's
				device. Also, another small thing a user pointed out was that he was color-blind. Some of the color schemes on 
				the personal page did not favor him well.
